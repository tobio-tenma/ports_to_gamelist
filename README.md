# ports_to_gamelist.py

This is very much a **work in progress**

A simple utility that converts PortMaster ports.json into gamelist.xml format for EmulationStation. It's been tested on Ark OS and JELOS so far.

## Usage

The script is called with the ports.json file provided as the argument.

**Example Usage**:

```python ports_to_gamelist.py ports.json```

## Troubleshooting

You can use the [JSON validation schema](https://github.com/kloptops/harbourmaster/blob/main/data/ports.schema.json) to to ensure that your input json is formatted correctly.

## Work in progress
